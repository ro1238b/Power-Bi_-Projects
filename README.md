Project Title
Crop Production Analysis Using Power BI
Problem Statement:-
Agriculture plays a critical role in the economy, and understanding crop production patterns is vital for planning, resource allocation, and policy-making. However, the large volume of agricultural data, spread across various dimensions such as crop types, seasons, regions, and years, presents a challenge for effective analysis and decision-making.

Steps followed:-
Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.Collect the data from Kaggle.com
Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
Step 3 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.
Step 4 : Create a Front page to describe my Project.
Step 5 : I did a quick calculation in my notebook to determine the goals I need to meet for this project.
Step 6 : Select appropiate visualization tools like Charts, Graphs, Tables that effectively represent my data.
Step 7 : Arrange the visuals on the dashboard for clear and intuitive navigation. Ensure that the design is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
Step 9 : Add slicers ,filters options to make the dashboard interactive.
Pages Content:-
Page 1:- [Front page] Simply contain the project's heading.

Page 2:- [Area Production Season] Use "New Slicer" to add Season column to the data field. Create a Year Slicer using the Year column.Create a "donut chart" use State_name as Legend data Value and Year as Value . [Objective] - Determine the total area of the state used for Agriculture in a certain season. Across the year(1997-2015).Create a "donut chart" use District_name as Legend data Value and Year as Value . [Objective] - Determine the total area of the District of this State are used for Agriculture in a certain season. Across the year(1997-2015).Create two Cards for Total Area and Crop. After that create a "Stacked bar chart" to using Crop at y-axis and District_name at x-axis [Objective] - Determine the Top 20 crops of india cultivate in a perticular season. Create a visual Table with using of two columns are crop and Production.[objective] - Shows the overall agricultural production for a specific year and season. Atlast has included a digital map that displays the state names based on top productivity. This potential dashboard is mostly used to collect information such as total area by season, total crop cultivate in a certain season, top 5 states that grow a specific crop in a specific season, and vice versa for districts, among other things....

Page 3:- It is used to calculate perticticular crop production in a year (using "Area chart") and the number of crops grown in all those years (1997-2014) using a line chart. Use a "Line and clustered column chart" to calculate the standard deviation of area by year. Create a "Donut chart" to determine which states a specific crop may be grown in during a given year and season. [objective] - it is mostly utilized to determine any specifics about a certain crop.

Page 4:- This page includes four new slicers: Season Slicer, State Slicer, District Slicer, and Year Slicer, which allow you to find out the worth of a crop's state, district, year, and season in detail.
